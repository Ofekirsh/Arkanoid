# Arkanoid

This project is a Java implementation of the classic **Arkanoid** game, developed as part of a rolling project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at university.

The game demonstrates key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and modular design. It features brick-breaking gameplay where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the bricks on the screen.
